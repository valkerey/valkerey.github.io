# Summary

I am the best for this job because I can speak 10 different languages on a rotating basis. Whether that be coding languages or IRL languages is for me to know and you to find out! Other than that, none have beaten me at Mario Kart (my brother is the exception, but I wouldn't like to get into that), and I know that is a very hot skill in this market. So yeah that's basically it and should be all you need.
